# Malware & analysis

[← Back to FAQ index](faq.md)

---

### Can I see the source code for the lab samples?

Outside of the few examples where source is shown for teaching: no. Malware authors don’t hand you source code, and neither will I for the labs.

---

### What screenshot tool do you use in the videos?

Greenshot. Use any screenshot tool that works for you.

---

### What note-taking software do you recommend?

Use whatever you’ll actually use consistently. In the course I use OneNote; professionally I use Obsidian. The important part is that you take notes and document everything.

---

### What theme do you use in Visual Studio Code?

Dracula: <https://draculatheme.com/>

### “Detonating Our First Sample”: I run Ransomware.wannacry.exe.malz as admin and nothing happens

- For this detonation, turn INetSim off. You’ll see later why WannaCry doesn’t detonate with INetSim on.
- If you already ran it before, clear the DNS cache on FLARE-VM:

```cmd
ipconfig /flushdns
```

Then try again.

### “Detonating Our First Sample”: the sample in the video looks different from the repo

Yes. The sample at:

`PMAT-labs/labs/4-1.Bossfight-wannacry.exe/Ransomware.wannacry.exe.malz.7z`

is the same sample used in the video. The repo layout was changed after the video was recorded. When in doubt, use the sample listed above the video.

### [Malware sample] doesn’t seem to do [malicious activity]. What’s going on?

Usually one of these:

1. Working but not obvious — It may be running without visible effect. Use other tools and techniques to find IOCs.
2. Environment-dependent — Try with INetSim on and with the VM offline and see if behavior changes.
3. Environmental keying — 🐈‍⬛ cosmo.jpeg must be on the Desktop of your FLARE-VM (see lab README).
4. Defender / Firewall — FLARE-VM may not have disabled Defender or Windows Firewall. In this lab it’s safe to disable both for detonation.

Related: If FLARE-VM can ping REMnux but REMnux can’t ping FLARE-VM, Windows Firewall is likely blocking ICMP. Disable the firewall on FLARE-VM (this is supposed to happen during install but sometimes doesn’t).

### Can you help me troubleshoot [something not in the course]?

I support only the prescribed lab tools and platforms from the course. I’m happy to discuss other tools, samples, and techniques, but I can’t troubleshoot or fix issues with them. If you use something outside the course setup, it’s on you to fix and maintain it.

---

### I did something that infected my physical host. What do I do?

Learn from it, and (re)read the lab repo README (including the 🔴 big red circles 🔴) and the EULA.

### CAPA doesn’t show MITRE TTP output for the sample in that section

CAPA’s output and which rules fire change between versions. If you don’t see MITRE TTPs for `Malware.Unknown.exe.malz`, try running CAPA on WannaCry; that sample should produce TTP output.
