### Can I use the Windows 11 Eval ISO instead of Windows 10?

Yes. Windows 11 is supported for FLARE-VM. With Windows 10 at end-of-life, using Windows 11 is a good choice.

### Windows 10 is EoL and no longer in the Evaluation Center. What do I do?

Option 1 — Windows 10
- Get the ISO from the Media Creation Tool:  <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10>
- Follow the course instructions as usual.

Option 2 — Windows 11
- Use the Evaluation Center Windows 11 Enterprise ISO:  
  <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise>
- If your host has TPM, the VM install may differ slightly from the course; follow the on-screen steps.
